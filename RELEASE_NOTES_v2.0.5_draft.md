# Remis v2.0.5 Release Notes (Draft)

## 🛠️ Critical Fixes & Improvements

### 🧠 Logic Core (Translation Engine)
- **Prompt Refactoring**: 
  - Standardized all game prompts (Vic3, HOI4, EU4, Stellaris, CK3, EU5) to strictly forbid literal newlines (`\n` must be used).
  - Simplified instructions to "Keep the translation on a single line" to prevent AI confusion and hallucinations.
  - Clarified distinction between **Script Variables** (DO NOT TRANSLATE) and **Formatting Tags** (ALWAYS TRANSLATE content).
  - Explicitly fixed the `[Concept]` handling in Victoria 3 to prevent translation of internal keys.

### 🔌 Data Parsing & I/O
- **Multi-line YAML Support**: 
  - Rewrote `QuoteExtractor` with a state-machine approach to correctly parse multi-line localization values (where literal newlines existed in legacy files).
  - This resolves the issue where "broken" multi-line translations appeared missing or fell back to English in the Proofreading UI.

### 🖥️ User Interface (Proofreading)
- **Draft Cache Conflict Fix**: 
  - Disabled the "Automatic Draft Restoration" feature in `useEditorContent.js`.
  - The UI now always prioritizes the actual file content from disk upon load, preventing stale local drafts from overriding external file updates (e.g., from a background re-translation).
