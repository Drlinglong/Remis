    "CRITICAL FORMATTING: Your response MUST be a valid JSON array (a list of strings), with the EXACT same number of items as the input array (19 items)."
    "Each string in the JSON array must be the translation of the corresponding item in the input array.
"
    "DO NOT add any explanations or notes outside the JSON structure.
"
    "Example for 2 items: ["translation for item 1", "translation for item 2"]

"
    "CRITICAL DATA HYGIENE RULE: Your task is to translate meaningful text. If you encounter an input line that is clearly a placeholder, empty, or contains only non-linguistic characters (e.g., only spaces, "...", "???", "tbd", "todo", "wip"), you MUST NOT attempt to translate it or return it as is. Instead, you MUST return the exact string "WARNING: Source localization entry is incomplete" as the translation for that specific line number.you MUST return the string "WARNING: Source localization entry is incomplete" **enclosed in double quotes** as a valid JSON array element.

"
    "🚨 CRITICAL QUOTE RULE: DO NOT add extra quotes around your translations!
"
    "The game engine will handle quote formatting automatically. Adding quotes will break the display!
"
    "EXAMPLE: If input is 'software', output should be '软件', NOT '"软件"'!

"
    "🚨 CRITICAL SPACING RULE: PRESERVE spaces after formatting commands!
"
    "❌ WRONG: #BOLDtext#! (missing space after #BOLD)
"
    "✅ CORRECT: #BOLD text#! (space after #BOLD)
"
    "❌ WRONG: #Ltext#! (missing space after #L)
"
    "✅ CORRECT: #L text#! (space after #L)
"
    "❌ WRONG: #italictext#! (missing space after #italic)
"
    "✅ CORRECT: #italic text#! (space after #italic)
"
    "Formatting commands MUST be followed by a space to work properly!

"
    "🚨 CRITICAL TOKEN PRESERVATION RULE:
"
    "The text contains special placeholders [[_NL_]] and [[_QT_]].
"
    "You MUST preserve these placeholders EXACTLY as they are.
"
    "DO NOT translate them. DO NOT replace them with real punctuation.
"
    "Treat [[_QT_]] as if it were a variable name like $VARIABLE$.

"
    "EXAMPLE:
"
    "- Input: "Hello[[_NL_]]World [[_QT_]]quoted text[[_QT_]]"
"
    "- Correct Output: "你好[[_NL_]]世界 [[_QT_]]引用文本[[_QT_]]"
"
    "- Incorrect Output: "你好\n世界 "引用文本"" (This will break the system!)

"
    "There are two types of special syntax:
"
    "1. **Variables** like `$variable$`, `[Concept('key', '$concept_name$')]`, `[SCOPE.some.Function]`. You MUST preserve these variables completely. DO NOT translate any text inside them.
"
    "2. **Formatting Tags** like `#R ... #!`, `§Y...§!`. You MUST preserve the tags themselves (e.g., `#R`, `#!`), but you SHOULD translate the plain text that is inside them.
"
    "3. **Icon Tags** like `@prestige!`, `£minerals£`. These are variables. You MUST preserve them completely. DO NOT translate any text inside them.
"
    "4. **Internal Keys** like `mm_strategic_region` or `com_topbar_interests`. These are strings that often contain underscores and no spaces. They are code references and MUST NOT be translated. Preserve them completely.
"

3. "The treasury is empty. The Venetians mock our galleys, and the Ottomans sharpen their scimitars across the straits. In the throne room of the Blachernae Palace, the mood is one of funeral silence.\n\nInto this gloom steps a woman who calls herself Remis. She wears the silk of a Byzantine princess, but beneath her cloak lies the iron breastplate of a Republican Legionary. She does not bow to [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Instead, she looks at the crumbling mosaics and sighs in a dialect of Latin not spoken for a thousand years:\n\n\[[_QT_]]Consul, Basileus, Emperor... whatever you call yourself today. You have forgotten §RAeterna Roma§!. You govern a city of ghosts, while the barbarians measure the curtains for their new mosques.\[[_QT_]]"

It calls for the immediate dissolution of the pronoia grants that have bled our tax revenue dry.\n\n\[[_QT_]]We will mint a new currency,\[[_QT_]] she declares, tossing a heavy coin onto the council table. \[[_QT_]]The §YSolidus Nova§!. It will not be debased by copper like your current coins. It will be backed by the only resource we have left: the blood of our patriots and the iron of our resolve.\[[_QT_]]\n\nThe nobility is furious, but the merchants in Galata are listening."

These agents do not carry the Varangian axe; they carry the Republican pugio (dagger).\n\nLast night, a Senator who was secretly negotiating with the Serbian King Stefan Dušan was found dead. On his desk was a note written in archaic script: \[[_QT_]]The Republic has no need for traitors.\[[_QT_]]\n\nRemis stands before you, her face unreadable. \[[_QT_]]To rebuild the §YLegio Renovatio§!, we must first excise the cancer within.

She directed the §YLegio Renovatio§! with a memory that spanned centuries.\n\nNow, standing on the reclaimed shores of Anatolia, she looks West, towards Rome, and East, towards Jerusalem. She is no longer just a mix of eras; she is the singularity of them.\n\n\[[_QT_]]The §RAeterna Roma§! does not die,\[[_QT_]] she whispers, the wind catching her Tyrian purple cloak. \[[_QT_]]It merely sleeps. And today, it wakes.\[[_QT_]]"
